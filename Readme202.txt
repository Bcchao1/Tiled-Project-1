Example Output: 

--in containing folder as well as "neat images" folder

How to run code:

--open CMD
--direct CMD to drive containing project folder
--run in CMD: dotnet run WaveFunctionCollapse.csproj

Rules and Constraints:

--Image Size is 30 x 30 pixels max
--Image must be represented by one simple slice of a pattern (ex. spiral, square, curve, etc.)
--The source image can be more than one color.

--Pattern Size: N=3
--Symmetry = 4
--Periodic=True
--Dimensions 100x100


Explain your process in creating a good output:

--First we illustrate our own tiles in the app Tiled
--We export multicolored tiles as large as 30x30 with simple geometric designs integrated into them.
--We plug the tiles into the algorithm and through our constraints and receive aesethtically pleasing backgrounds that have a 
consistent geometric pattern aesthetic.
